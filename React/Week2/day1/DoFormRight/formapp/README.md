# Using react hook forms and yup for validation 
- [Documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- React Hook Form takes a slightly different approach than other form libraries in the React ecosystem by adopting the use of uncontrolled inputs using ref instead of depending on the state to control the inputs. This approach makes the forms more performant and reduces the number of re-renders.


- Another great feature offered by React Hook Form is its painless integration with UI libraries because most libraries support the ref attribute.

- To install React Hook Form, run the following command:
             `npm install react-hook-form`
