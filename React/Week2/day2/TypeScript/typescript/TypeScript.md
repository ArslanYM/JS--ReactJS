# Integrating Typescript App 
- To install a typescript app 
 - ` npx create-react-app {nameofapp} --template typescript`

 -  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that any JavaScript code can be compiled into TypeScript. TypeScript offers many advantages over JavaScript including the following:

   - TypeScript is more type-safe and offers better compile-time error checking than JavaScript.
   - TypeScript provides developers with the ability to use modern object-oriented programming features such as classes and modules. 
   -TypeScript supports static type checking, which means that the compiler will detect errors in code at compile time rather than run time. 
   -TypeScript has generics, type inference, and pattern matching. Generics allow developers to define functions or classes without specifying their types. Generics are especially helpful for working with large data structures where the specific types need not be known at compile time.
